# roman-numeral-converter

*FINISHED*

A program to convert a given number into the equivalent set of roman numerals. This exercise comes from freeCodeCamp.org. I admit the code is not the most elegant or concise, but I'm still proud to say that I figured this code out on my own (as with the rest of these project) without looking at the solutions.
